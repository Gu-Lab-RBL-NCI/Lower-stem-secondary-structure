# Lower-stem-secondary-structure
### Scripts used for the analysis of the pri-miRNA lower stem structure.

Genomic sequences of pri-miRNAs were obtained from [UCSC Genome Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/). Each pri-miRNA analyzed consists of the pre-miRNA and flanking sequences of 30 nt both sides. The secondary structure was obtained using RNAfold(Gruber et al., 2008), and the bracket-dot notation of the lower stem was analyzed using this R scripts.

In brief, we first tested whether a nucleotide in one position is paired with another on the other side of the pre-miRNA. Nucleotides that failed such a test were labeled as unpaired. Then, we aligned all pri-miRNA 5p sequences by the 5’ Drosha cleavage site (5’ end of pre-miRNA) and aligned all 3p sequences by the 3’ Drosha cleavage site (3’ end of pre-miRNA). The percentage of paired nucleotides was calculated for each position and was plotted against its relative distance to the Drosha cleavage site.

### Example 1
**1. pri-miRNA secondary structure**

Secondary structure from pri-miRNA sequence reported in [miRBase 21](http://www.mirbase.org/) usually don't contain many upstream or downstream nucleotides from the Drosha cleavage sites.

```
>hsa-mir-9-1
(.(((((((((((((((.((((((.(.(....).).)))))).))))))))))))))).))
```

Therefore, we obtained the secondary structure from pri-miRNA sequence obtained from longer genomic sequences on [UCSC Genome Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/)

```
......(((((...(.(((((((....((((.(((((((((((((((.((((((.(.(....).).)))))).))))))))))))))).))))...))))))).)...))).)).......
```

*Note that in most cases the secondary structure of the pri-miRNA sequence reported in miRBase21 is already included in the longer sequence. Most discrepancies might come from alternative foldings derived from providing extra-context to RNAfold.*

**2. Isolate the 5' and 3' lower stem segments**

Structure of the 5' lower stem

```
-30__________________________-1
......(((((...(.(((((((....(((
```

Structure of the 3' lower stem

```
+1_________________________+30`
))...))))))).)...))).)).......
```

**3. Fraction of stem base-paired nucleotides**

For each position on the lower stem, we count the frequency of nucleotides on the 5' with `(` over the total, while on the 3' we count only the `)`.


### Example 2
**4. Detection of secondary stems**

It is not unfrequent to detect pri-miRNA where the lower stem, due to its less structured nature, presents secondary stems.

```
hsa-mir-152 5' lower stem
-30__________________________-1
..((((...)))..))((((..((.(((((
```

In such cases, our script excludes those positions from the being counted as "lower stem base-paired" nucleotides. To that aim our code replaces in the bracket-dot notation, the brackets on the secondary stem for `*`.

```
hsa-mir-152 5' lower stem
-30__________________________-1
..***....***..**((((..((.(((((
```
